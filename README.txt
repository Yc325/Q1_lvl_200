This code demonstrates how to generate and decode a short code based on a combination of a store ID and transaction ID using base 36 encoding.

Usage
To use the code, you can call the generateShortCode() function by passing in the store ID and transaction ID as arguments. This function will encode the IDs as a base 36 string, slice the string to a maximum length of 9 characters, and return the short code as a string.
You can then use the decodeShortCode() function to decode the short code back into its original store ID and transaction ID values. This function will decode the short code from base 36 and extract the store ID and transaction ID. 
It returns an object containing the store ID, transaction ID, and the current date as the shopping date.

Limitations
The current implementation is limited to generating short codes based on store IDs that are 5 digits or less, and transaction IDs that are 4 digits or less. 
If the store ID or transaction ID is longer, the short code will be truncated to 9 characters.
Additionally, the current implementation may not be secure enough to prevent cheaters from guessing the short codes.

Future Improvements
To improve security, we could implement additional measures such as adding a secret key to the encoding process or using a more secure encoding algorithm.
We could also modify the code to generate short codes based on longer store IDs and transaction IDs. 
One way to achieve this would be to encode the IDs using a larger base, such as base 62, which includes all uppercase and lowercase letters in addition to numbers.
